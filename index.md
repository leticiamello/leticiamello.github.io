## Modeling of Space Structures Using the Finite Element Method and Spectral Element Method

Hi! My name is Leticia and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Unesp - São Paulo State University, and a member of NDE (Nucleus of Dynamics in Engineering). My current project is about dynamics of space structures. This page is where I am going to talk about it and trace my accomplishments.

## About the project
This project is my subject of research in my undergraduate scientific research at Unesp - São Paulo State University, supported by NDE (Nucleus of Dynamics in Engineering) and funded by CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development).

The objectives of this research are the implementation of MATLAB codes to undestand the behavior of a space truss and methods of analysis, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method and control of vibration. The model will be developed using unidimensional elements (bars).

This is the truss i'm working with:

And this is the truss during it's 15th mode of vibration:
